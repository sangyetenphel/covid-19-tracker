Use AI to track COVID-19 contraction chances in Hollywood

Given an actor name, the app traces down and tries to find a connection to another actor who has been tested positive for COVID-19. 
This can be treated as an AI search problem where we are trying to find the shortest path between 2 actors.
Our states are people. Our actions are movies, which take us from one actor to another.
Our initial state and goal state are defined by the two people weâ€™re trying to connect.
By using breadth-first search, we can find the shortest path from one actor to another.


The app also shows the latest Coronavirus cases in the U.S.
For this I used a python web scraper i.e. BeautifulSoup4 to scape data from the source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

Finally, I generate some random facts about the virus on the botton left section which changes on every http request made.
