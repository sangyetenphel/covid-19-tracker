# COVID-19 TRACKER
Use AI to track COVID-19 contraction chances in Hollywood.

### About

Given an actor name, the app traces down and tries to find a connection to another actor who has been tested positive for COVID-19. 
We treat this as an AI search problem where we are trying to find the shortest path between 2 actors.
Our states are people. Our actions are movies, which take us from one actor to another.
Our initial state and goal state are defined by the two people weâ€™re trying to connect.
By using breadth-first search, we can find the shortest path from one actor to another in a database of 1044500 different actors.


The app also shows the latest Coronavirus cases in the U.S.
For this I used a python web scraper i.e. BeautifulSoup4 to scape data from the source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

Finally, I generate some random facts about the virus on the botton left section which changes on every http request made.


### Usage

1. Download the folder 'covid_tracker_large' or 'covid_tracker_json' which uses a JSON file instead of a python dictionary to load the huge dataset of all Hollywood actors from source: https://www.imdb.com/.

2. Cd into the folder where there is a manage.py file in it. Run `<python manage.py runserver>` to open the app in your local browser.

Alternatively you can visit this site for a lite version of the same app but with smaller dataset. https://covidtrackerhollywood.herokuapp.com/
